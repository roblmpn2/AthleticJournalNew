            <p class="welcome-to-my">
              I am a 15-year-old boy from Oakland, CA, who has participated in
              various computer science programs and is also a track athlete. I
              saw the need for a tool that would help me keep track of my
              weight, nutrition, injuries, games, and all other aspects related
              to my athletic performance.
            </p>
            <p class="welcome-to-my">
              My journal is designed to be easy to use, customization, and
              effective. I believe that every athlete is unique and has
              different needs, which is why I have created a journal that can be
              tailored to your specific goals and requirements. Whether you are
              a beginner or a seasoned athlete, my journal can help you stay
              organized and focused on achieving your targets.
            </p>

                I am committed to providing you with the best possible
                experience. I am constantly working to improve my journal and
                add new features that will help you track your progress and
                achieve your goals. I believe that with hard work,
                determination, and the right tools, anyone can achieve their
                athletic dreams.
